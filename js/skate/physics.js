// The ride model: everything that decides where the board goes, and what the
// rider's body is doing about it.
//
// The board is not a rigid body with a collision mesh. It is a contact patch on a
// height field, and the state that matters is small: a position, a heading, a
// scalar speed along that heading, and a lean. That is deliberate — a general
// rigid-body solver would spend all of its time keeping an 0.8 m plank from
// jittering on the concrete and none of it on the things that make skating feel
// like skating.
//
// What the model does insist on being right about:
//
//   Turning is a balance problem. Leaning by θ commits you to a lateral
//   acceleration of g·tanθ, so the radius is v²/(g·tanθ) — wide at speed, tight
//   at a crawl, and never something the player sets directly.
//
//   Leaving the ground is a consequence, not a state change. Every step compares
//   the surface against a free-fall path, and when the concrete drops away faster
//   than gravity can pull the board down, the board is in the air. Rolling off a
//   ledge, launching out of a transition and popping an ollie all fall out of that
//   one test instead of out of three separate rules.
//
//   A landing can be refused. The board has to be roughly level, roughly pointing
//   where it is going, and finished with whatever it started. Miss any of those
//   and the run ends on the floor.
